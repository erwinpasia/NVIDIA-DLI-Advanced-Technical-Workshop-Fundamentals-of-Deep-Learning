# NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute's (DLI) Fundamentals of Deep Learning

This repository provides an overview of the **Fundamentals of Deep Learning** course, offered by NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute (DLI). The course is designed to teach participants the foundational concepts of deep learning through hands-on exercises in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). By the end of the course, participants will have a solid understanding of how to train and optimize neural networks using modern deep learning frameworks.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental techniques and tools required to train a deep learning model.
- Gain experience with common deep learning data types and model architectures.
- Enhance datasets through data augmentation to improve model accuracy.
- Leverage transfer learning between models to achieve efficient results with less data and computation.
- Build confidence to take on your own project with a modern deep learning framework.

## Overview of Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to learn from vast amounts of data. It powers many AI applications, such as speech recognition, image classification, and language translation. NVIDIA's DLI course focuses on practical applications of deep learning in domains like healthcare, retail, and autonomous vehicles.

### Key Concepts in Deep Learning

- **Neural Networks**: Multi-layered networks that learn from data by adjusting weights based on error gradients.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: A specialized type of neural network used primarily for image-related tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Networks designed for sequential data, often used in NLP tasks.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models to solve new problems with less data and computation.

## Hands-On Exercises

The course emphasizes practical experience through hands-on labs, where participants will:

1. Train their first computer vision model using convolutional neural networks.
2. Apply data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
3. Use pre-trained models to accelerate development and achieve high accuracy with minimal training.
4. Train recurrent neural networks for text-based tasks like text autocompletion.

### Key Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks

- **TensorFlow**: A popular open-source library for machine learning and deep learning.
- **Keras**: A high-level API built on TensorFlow that simplifies the process of building neural networks.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Python libraries for data manipulation and numerical computation.

## Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning

One major focus of the course is teaching how to enhance datasets through **data augmentation**, which helps improve model accuracy by artificially expanding training datasets. Additionally, participants will learn about **transfer learning**, a technique that allows them to use pre-trained models to solve new problems quickly and efficiently.

### Key Benefits of Transfer Learning:
- Reduces training time by leveraging pre-trained models.
- Requires less labeled data for training new models.
- Achieves high accuracy with minimal computational resources.

## End-to-End Workflow Acceleration

The course emphasizes building efficient workflows where every stage—from data preprocessing to model training—is optimized using state-of-the-art tools. By integrating libraries like TensorFlow and Keras into these workflows, participants can achieve significant speedups compared to traditional methods.

### Benefits of Optimized Workflows:
- Faster iteration cycles due to reduced computation time at each stage.
- Scalability across larger datasets without sacrificing performance.

## Final Project: Object Classification

In the final project, participants will apply their knowledge by building a computer vision model that distinguishes between fresh and rotten fruit. This project will involve:

- Creating and training a model that interprets color images.
- Building a data generator to maximize the use of small datasets.
- Combining transfer learning with feature extraction to improve training speed.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have an understanding of fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as functions, loops, dictionaries, and arrays. Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts is also recommended but not required.

Suggested preparation materials:
- Codecademy Python Course
- Introductory Machine Learning tutorials

## Certificate

Upon successful completion of the course assessment, participants will receive an official **NVIDIA DLI certificate**, recognizing their subject matter competency in deep learning.

## Conclusion

By completing this course, participants will gain hands-on experience in building deep learning models for real-world applications. The knowledge gained will enable them to:

- Train neural networks from scratch or using pre-trained models.
- Apply advanced techniques such as transfer learning and data augmentation.
- Build end-to-end workflows optimized for both performance and scalability.

This course is ideal for developers, data scientists, or anyone interested in gaining practical knowledge in deep learning using industry-standard tools.
